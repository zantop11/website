## Early Life

I have been working with computers since I was a kid, when we got our first Packard Bell desktop in 1993.

I was immediately hooked and spent all my time messing around with DOS 3.1 and trying to understand what made computers "tick". And I really needed to learn how open The Lost Vikings. My father was also very interested in computers, and wanted to start a business fixing them. This prompted us to scour at local trade shows over the years for any new components we could get our hands one and be early adopters to new technology. I remeber waiting in line once for what seemed like hours, just to get our hands on a **$500** CD-RW burner, which was a **big** deal at the time.

Over these formative years, I spent much of my time inside of a PC, software or hardware. When I was not messing around inside a PC, I was likely playing video games on one. We also pushed into networks and servers as my dad's business shifted gears into small business work. Learning Windows server and the interconnectivity of multiple PC's was the further push I needed. This dove me into setting up my first server, a basic file server, just to test transferring documents between machines. Naturally, I would often tag along on these network setups with my dad to help and learn.

## Linux Discovered

While reading some forums, I discovered a Linux distrobution call ***Ubuntu***. I decided to have a DVD mailed to me and waited with anticipation. As soon as it arrived, I wiped my machine and installed it. I fell in love with Linux, the speed it launched application, the customization options, the different desktop style, and the open source nature. From here I began to tinker with Linux servers and wanted to shift everyone to this new experience.

In high school I took a networking class, and met other like minded individuals. We even won 5th place in the nation at a Networking Design event. But college and Minecraft were the true turning point in my life. I set up an Ubuntu server, running Minecraft for friends. This started orginially for just my girlfriend and I to play in the evenings together. Then sprawled into most of my firends playing at all hours of the day. 

Realizing servers could be more than just for basic file transfers and business operations, I wanted to start to journey into more self-hosted options. Hunting for any "self-hosters" that had ideas around what you could host on your own private servers. I learned media was a great option, and discovered **Plex**. This was perfect, my girlfriend had a huge DVD collection, and the easiest option was to RIP them to a single server (which was an old desktop).
